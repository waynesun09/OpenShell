# RFC 0006 - Gateway Interceptors

## Summary

Operators and external integrators need a flexible way to customize gateway API
behavior to fit their own requirements — for example, enforcing tenancy,
quotas, naming conventions, or policy authority. Today any such customization
has to be hardcoded into gateway handlers or pushed into drivers, which mixes
responsibilities and does not scale to deployment-specific requirements.

This RFC proposes a first-class extension system that lets external services
observe, modify, validate, reject, or audit gateway operations at well-defined
phases. We call these **Gateway Interceptors**.

Interceptors and drivers serve different extension needs. Interceptors add business logic
around gateway operations. Drivers replace or provide implementation for
platform functionality, such as how sandboxes are provisioned on Docker,
Kubernetes, or VMs.

This RFC scopes interceptors to gateway API operations. An interceptor can
observe, modify, validate, reject, or audit a gateway operation at well-defined
phases. Future RFCs may extend interceptors to other gateway functionality,
such as event-driven or workflow behavior, but that is out of scope for this
first implementation.

Drivers continue to own platform implementation — how gateway functionality is
actually provided. Interceptors own gateway-level governance for resource
writes: tenancy, quotas, naming, policy authority, and driver configuration
restrictions.

The gateway database remains the system of record. Interceptors add governance
around gateway operations; they do not replace gateway-owned state.

## Motivation

Operators running OpenShell in their own environments need to apply
deployment-specific rules to gateway operations that core OpenShell does not
encode. Examples include:

- Sync policies and providers from an external source of truth.
- Enforce one system-wide sandbox policy and reject custom sandbox policies.
- Verify policy writes against an external authority before accepting them.
- Restrict driver configuration payloads to an approved schema or fixed value.
- Limit each user to a maximum number of running sandboxes.

These are not core OpenShell semantics. They vary per deployment, and the set
changes over time, so they are not a good fit for a fixed set of built-in
options.

OpenShell already extends two of its subsystems. Drivers (RFC 0001) provide
implementations for the platform and infrastructure layer. Sandbox egress
middleware (RFC 0009) runs in the supervisor proxy and governs what an agent's
outbound requests may carry. Interceptors complete this pattern for the gateway
control plane: an extension point for the API operations themselves, where
deployment-specific rules like tenant quotas, policy authority, and naming
belong.

Some of these may ship as built-in gateway defaults over time. Interceptors do
not replace that — they let a deployment extend or override built-in defaults
when its rules differ, without waiting on an upstream change.

Without a dedicated mechanism, operators carry these rules as gateway forks or
local patches.

## Non-goals

- Replacing compute drivers or adding a second compute provisioning interface.
- Letting interceptors bypass gateway authentication, authorization, policy
  safety validation, or driver schema validation.
- Moving sandbox runtime enforcement out of the sandbox supervisor and proxy.
- Replacing the gateway database as the system of record.
- Adding new first-class gateway resource kinds for quotas, name policies,
  policy bundles, or driver config policy.

## Proposal

Add a gateway interceptor framework with explicit phases, RPC method selectors,
deterministic ordering, bounded execution, audit logging, and conservative
failure behavior.

Interceptors do not replace gateway functionality. They add governance and
business logic around gateway operations: defaulting, validation, rejection,
and audit. Replacing how core functionality is implemented remains the role of
drivers and other provider-style interfaces.

The design keeps two boundaries intact:

- The gateway database remains the system of record for gateway-owned state.
- Existing gateway and driver validation still run after interceptor
  modification.

### Gateway API interceptors

A gateway API interceptor runs during a gateway API operation, such as creating a
sandbox, importing provider profiles, updating policy, or applying sandbox
configuration. It may modify an RPC request or operation input only in
modification phases. It may reject in validation phases. It may attach warnings
and audit annotations in all phases.

Interceptor services expose one or more bindings. A binding is a
service-declared rule that maps the service to phases, gateway RPC methods, and
selectors. The gateway uses bindings to decide when to call the service.

The public gRPC service and method identify the API operation. The v1 selector
vocabulary uses fully qualified RPC names, for example
`openshell.v1.OpenShell/CreateSandbox`. This keeps binding configuration tied
to the public API operators already know and avoids another compatibility
surface.

All interceptable gateway API RPCs run through the same standard phase pipeline.
The gateway rejects interceptor bindings that reference unknown RPCs for the
running gateway version, unless the RPC selector is empty to match all
interceptable RPCs.

Gateway API interceptors should work for all relevant gateway RPCs, not a
hand-maintained subset. New gateway RPCs should enter the interceptor pipeline by
using the shared gateway API execution path, not by adding per-RPC interceptor
hooks or updating a separate allowlist. RPCs may opt out only when they are not
gateway API operations in scope for this RFC, such as low-level streaming or
supervisor-internal calls, and the opt-out should be explicit in code review.

This lets OpenShell add deployment-specific business logic around the gateway
operations it already supports while keeping runtime reads local and
deterministic.

### Operation phases

Operation phases are ordered. Later phases see the result of earlier phases. All
interceptable gateway API RPCs use the same phases in the same order so
interceptor authors and operators do not need per-RPC phase rules.

| Phase | Modification allowed | Purpose | Examples |
|---|---:|---|---|
| `pre_request` | yes | Normalize or reject the RPC request after auth and basic size limits. | Normalize labels, require a sandbox name prefix, or reject requests with unsupported request fields. |
| `modify_operation` | yes | Apply defaults or controlled changes after the gateway prepares the operation input. | Stamp a default sandbox policy, select a provider profile, or clamp resource limits to deployment defaults. |
| `validate` | no | Enforce deployment-specific rules before persistence, provisioning, or other side effects. | Enforce tenant quotas, reject policy updates that allow internet egress, or verify driver config against an approved schema. |
| `post_commit` | no | Emit audit or notify external systems after successful persistence or provisioning. | Send audit records, notify an inventory system, or trigger a reconciliation job after a successful write. |

Gateway invariants run after modification so interceptors cannot leave invalid
objects in the system. Operation-specific built-in validation, including driver
validation where applicable, remains part of the gateway-owned execution path so
drivers stay the authority for driver-owned schemas.

### Interceptor request contract

The interceptor request should be stable and tied to the public gateway API, not
to Rust handler internals.

```proto
message InterceptorEvaluation {
  string api_version = 1;
  string interceptor_name = 2;
  string binding_id = 3;
  string phase = 4;
  string rpc_service = 5;
  string rpc_method = 6;

  string principal = 7;
  map<string, string> context = 8;

  google.protobuf.Struct operation_input = 9;
  google.protobuf.Struct existing_state = 10;
  google.protobuf.Struct rpc_request = 11;
}
```

The `rpc_service` and `rpc_method` fields are the split form of the fully
qualified RPC selector used by bindings. For example,
`openshell.v1.OpenShell/CreateSandbox` becomes
`rpc_service = "openshell.v1.OpenShell"` and
`rpc_method = "CreateSandbox"`.

The payload fields are phase-scoped. `rpc_request` is the raw gateway RPC
payload available to `pre_request`. `operation_input` is the gateway-prepared
input available after state loading and defaulting; it is the main payload for
`modify_operation`, `validate`, and `post_commit`. `existing_state` is populated
only when the operation has prior gateway-owned state.

The interceptor response returns an allow/deny decision, optional patches, and
diagnostic metadata for gateway API interceptors.

```proto
message InterceptorDecision {
  bool allowed = 1;
  string reason = 2;
  string status_code = 3;
  repeated JsonPatch patches = 4;
  repeated string warnings = 5;
  map<string, string> audit_annotations = 6;
}
```

Only modification phases accept patches. `pre_request` patches apply to
`rpc_request`; `modify_operation` patches apply to `operation_input`.
`validate` and `post_commit` interceptors that return patches are configuration
errors.

The `binding_id` is owned by the interceptor service. It identifies the
service-declared binding that selected the evaluation.

### Interceptor endpoints

The framework uses one protobuf/gRPC service contract. The gateway derives the
endpoint type and TLS mode from the interceptor endpoint URI:

- `grpc://host:port` connects to a plaintext gRPC interceptor service over TCP.
- `grpcs://host:port` connects to a TLS-protected gRPC interceptor service over TCP.
- `unix:///path/to/socket` connects to a gRPC interceptor service over a Unix domain
  socket.

Remote gRPC interceptors require authentication. The exact configuration shape
is out of scope for this RFC, but the implementation should support mTLS and
bearer-token authentication.

### Selection and ordering

Selection should be oriented around interceptor services, not individual
phase/RPC routes. Operators should normally configure a small number of
interceptor services and service-specific settings. The service tells the
gateway which RPC bindings it supports.

A `[[interceptors]]` table in the gateway config TOML represents one interceptor
service instance. During gateway startup or config reload, the gateway calls a
`Describe` RPC on the service. The response describes the service's default
bindings:

```proto
message InterceptorManifest {
  string api_version = 1;
  repeated InterceptorBinding bindings = 2;
}

message InterceptorBinding {
  string id = 1;
  repeated string phases = 2;
  repeated string rpcs = 3;
  int32 order = 4;
  bool modifies = 5;
  string default_failure_policy = 6;
  InterceptorSelector selector = 7;
}

message InterceptorSelector {
  repeated string principals = 1;
  map<string, string> labels = 2;
}
```

By default, the gateway enables the bindings returned by the service manifest.
Operators can configure the service once, then optionally override specific
bindings when they need to disable, narrow, or reorder behavior. Overrides
should only narrow service-declared selectors unless a future RFC explicitly
allows expansion.

Empty selector fields match all values. A gateway override can narrow a
service-declared selector, such as limiting a binding to a specific RPC.

Gateway config example for a remote policy provider:

```toml
[[interceptors]]
name = "policy-provider"
endpoint = "grpcs://policy-provider.example.com:8443"
failure_policy = "fail_closed"
timeout = "500ms"
```

The service manifest keeps common configuration terse. Operators do not need to
know which phase each behavior runs in; the service exposes those bindings.

The gateway builds an execution plan from enabled bindings. Selection evaluates
the service-declared RPC, phase, principal, and label selectors, then applies
gateway-configured narrowing overrides.

Interceptors run in fixed phase order. Within a phase, matching bindings run by
this deterministic ordering:

1. configured interceptor service `order`.
2. service-declared binding `order`, after gateway overrides.
3. interceptor service name.
4. binding ID.

The gateway rejects interceptor configuration that creates ambiguous
modification order for the same field if that can be detected statically.

### Failure policy

Each binding has an effective failure policy. The gateway starts with the
service default, applies the interceptor service-level gateway config, then
applies any binding override.

| Failure policy | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `fail_closed` | Interceptor timeout or service error rejects the API operation. |
| `fail_open` | Interceptor timeout or service error permits the operation. The gateway emits warnings and audit logs. |
| `ignore` | Interceptor errors are logged only. Valid only for `post_commit`. |

Defaults:

- Modifying and validating bindings default to `fail_closed`.
- `post_commit` bindings default to `ignore`.

Every interceptor service has a timeout and response size limit. Gateway API
interceptor bindings also have a maximum patch count.

### Observability and audit

Every interceptor decision should emit structured gateway logs with:

- interceptor name.
- binding ID.
- phase.
- RPC service and method.
- principal.
- decision.
- reason.
- latency.
- failure policy.
- patch count.
- audit annotations.

Security-relevant denials should be emitted as OCSF detection findings or
configuration/security events, depending on the event class. Non-security
operational failures can use plain tracing.

### Example: remote policy provider

An interceptor should start from the invariant it wants to preserve, then find
every gateway API RPC that can establish or weaken that invariant. For example,
an operator may want a remote policy provider to be the authority for sandbox
policy decisions.

Two RPCs matter for this invariant:

- `openshell.v1.OpenShell/CreateSandbox` establishes the initial sandbox policy.
- `openshell.v1.OpenShell/UpdateConfig` changes sandbox or global policy.

The interceptor service declares one binding to apply an approved initial policy
and another to guard later policy changes:

```proto
InterceptorManifest {
  api_version: "v1"
  bindings: [
    {
      id: "sandbox-policy-default"
      phases: ["modify_operation"]
      rpcs: ["openshell.v1.OpenShell/CreateSandbox"]
      modifies: true
      default_failure_policy: "fail_closed"
    },
    {
      id: "policy-authority"
      phases: ["validate"]
      rpcs: ["openshell.v1.OpenShell/UpdateConfig"]
      modifies: false
      default_failure_policy: "fail_closed"
    }
  ]
}
```

The handler can then focus on the phase and RPC method that selected the
binding:

```rust
// Toy implementation of the InterceptorService evaluate RPC.
async fn evaluate(&self, req: InterceptorEvaluation) -> InterceptorDecision {
    match (req.rpc_method.as_str(), req.phase.as_str()) {
        // CreateSandbox: ask the remote policy provider for the approved
        // initial policy and stamp it into the prepared operation input.
        ("CreateSandbox", "modify_operation") => {
            let approved_policy = self.policy_provider.initial_policy(&req).await;

            InterceptorDecision::allow().with_patch(JsonPatch::replace(
                "/policy",
                approved_policy,
            ))
        }

        // UpdateConfig: reject policy writes the remote provider does not approve.
        ("UpdateConfig", "validate") => {
            let decision = self.policy_provider.validate_update(&req).await;
            if !decision.allowed {
                return InterceptorDecision::reject(
                    "PERMISSION_DENIED",
                    decision.reason,
                );
            }

            InterceptorDecision::allow()
        }

        // The service should only receive bound RPCs, but defaulting to allow
        // keeps the handler safe if the manifest grows later.
        _ => InterceptorDecision::allow(),
    }
}
```

The gateway config can stay small because the service manifest declares the
bindings:

```toml
[[interceptors]]
name = "policy-provider"
endpoint = "grpcs://policy-provider.example.com:8443"
failure_policy = "fail_closed"
timeout = "500ms"
```

This example illustrates the general interceptor design loop:

- Start with the invariant, then identify every RPC that can establish or weaken
  it.
- Pick the phase by intent: `modify_operation` to apply an approved initial
  policy and `validate` to reject unauthorized later changes.
- Use `fail_closed` because policy authority is a control-plane security
  boundary.
- Keep gateway validation after the interceptor so built-in policy safety checks
  still run.

## Implementation plan

1. Add a `crates/openshell-interceptors` crate with shared interceptor
   manifest, request/response, selector matching, ordering, failure policy
   handling, patch application, and test helpers.
2. Add interceptor configuration parsing to gateway config and validate it at startup.
3. Implement gRPC interceptor clients that derive TCP or Unix domain socket
   transport from the configured endpoint URI and call `Describe` during
   startup or config reload.
4. Build an execution plan from service manifests plus gateway-configured
   overrides.
5. Wire interceptor execution into the gateway API operation pipeline so all
   gateway operations can pass through `pre_request`, `modify_operation`,
   `validate`, and `post_commit` where applicable.
6. Audit existing gateway operations and route each resource-affecting path
   through the shared interceptor pipeline.
7. Add interceptor decision audit logging and metrics.
8. Document gateway interceptor configuration, endpoint requirements, failure
    modes, and security guidance.

## Risks

- Interceptors can make request behavior harder to reason about if ordering
  and audit are weak.
- Synchronous gRPC interceptor services can become availability dependencies for the
  gateway.
- Modifying interceptors can hide user intent if they silently rewrite user-supplied
  values.
- Ownership can become confusing when external controllers and humans both edit
  the same provider profile, provider, or policy through existing APIs.
- Quota interceptors need a stronger consistency design before they are safe in HA
  deployments.

Mitigations:

- Keep interceptors disabled by default.
- Make ordering deterministic and visible.
- Default modifying and validating interceptors to `fail_closed`.
- Run first-party invariant validation after modification.
- Make HA-unsafe interceptors declare their scope explicitly.

## Alternatives

### Add more gateway config fields

OpenShell could add first-party config fields for each requirement, such as
`sandbox_name_prefix`, `max_sandboxes_per_user`, and
`allowed_driver_config_keys`.

This is simple for known cases but does not scale to organization-specific
policy or external sources. It also keeps growing the gateway config schema for
controls that are not core OpenShell semantics.

Built-in fields and interceptors are not mutually exclusive. OpenShell may still
ship common defaults as first-party config; interceptors let a deployment extend
or override those defaults when its rules differ.

### Build a specific policy driver

OpenShell could add a dedicated policy driver interface for deployments that want
policy decisions to come from an external authority.

This solves one important use case, but it creates a narrow extension point for
one resource type instead of a general gateway operation framework. The same
deployments may need adjacent controls for sandbox creation, provider
profiles, quotas, naming, and audit. It would also be difficult to evolve:
OpenShell would need to expose policy-specific hooks that are likely to track
individual deployment use cases rather than a stable gateway operation contract.
This is different from compute drivers, which implement backend behavior after
the gateway has accepted an operation. A policy authority participates in the
gateway's decision to accept, reject, or modify the operation before
persistence, so it fits better as an interceptor than as a driver.

### Put this in compute drivers

Drivers already validate driver-owned config. They could also reject names,
quotas, and policy choices.

This mixes responsibilities. Drivers should own compute-platform feasibility.
The gateway should own API behavior, tenancy, policy authority, and provider
state. Interceptors are appropriate for additional business logic around gateway
operations; drivers are appropriate when OpenShell needs a different
implementation of compute functionality.

### Use HTTP webhooks

OpenShell could model interceptors as HTTP webhooks with JSON request and response
payloads.

This is familiar to Kubernetes users, but OpenShell already uses protobuf and
gRPC heavily. A protobuf gRPC contract avoids a second wire format for gateway
extension points, works over Unix domain sockets for local integrations, and
matches the gateway's existing service boundaries.
