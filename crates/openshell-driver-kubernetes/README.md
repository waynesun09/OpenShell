# openshell-driver-kubernetes

Kubernetes-backed compute driver for OpenShell cluster deployments.

The driver uses the Kubernetes API to create, delete, fetch, and watch sandbox
custom resources in the configured namespace. It runs in-process with the
gateway server.

## Runtime Model

The gateway stores platform state and delegates sandbox workload creation to
this driver. Kubernetes owns scheduling and pod lifecycle. The
`openshell-sandbox` supervisor inside each workload owns agent isolation,
credential injection, policy polling, logs, and the gateway relay.

## Sandbox Resource

The driver works with the `agents.x-k8s.io/v1alpha1` `Sandbox` custom resource.
Driver events map Kubernetes object state and platform events into the shared
compute-driver protobuf surface used by the gateway.

Kubernetes API calls use explicit timeouts so gRPC handlers do not block
indefinitely when the API server is slow or unavailable.

## Workspace Persistence

Sandbox pods use a PVC-backed `/sandbox` workspace. An init container seeds the
PVC from the image's original `/sandbox` contents on first start and writes a
sentinel so subsequent starts skip the copy.

This is a stopgap persistence model. It preserves user files across pod
rescheduling but duplicates the base workspace and does not automatically apply
image updates to existing PVCs. Future snapshotting should replace it.

## Credentials, TLS, and Relay

The driver injects gateway callback configuration, sandbox identity, TLS client
material, and the supervisor SSH socket path into the workload. Driver-owned
values must override image-provided environment variables.

The gateway uses the supervisor relay for connect, exec, and file sync. Sandbox
pods do not need direct external ingress for SSH.

## GPU Support

When a sandbox requests GPU support, the driver checks node allocatable capacity
for `nvidia.com/gpu`. A request with only `gpu=true` asks for one GPU. A request
with `gpu_count > 0` sets the pod resource limit to that count. The cluster must
expose `nvidia.com/gpu` through the NVIDIA device plugin or an equivalent
device-plugin implementation, and the sandbox image must provide the user-space
libraries needed by the agent workload.
